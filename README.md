## Lemmitization
Lemmatization is the algorithmic process of finding the lemma of a word depending on their meaning. Lemmatization aims to remove inflectional endings. It helps in returning the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. The major difference between stemming and lemmatizing is stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words
